# Google Api Books App Project

This project was built in React JS with Google Books Api. The app allows you to search books from the Google book library. The app has used react hooks with functional components only. The SCSS modules are utilised for the styling of the app.

Some of the majour functionalities are:

- A search input field to enter keyword and the Api call will be made based on the keywords entered.
- By default the search results will be showcased by relevance, however you can also sort it by newest by toggling the buttons.
- The results are by default displayed with grid style but you can also switch to list style.
- Upon click on each book card, the modal shows up with the further details of the clicked book.
- A load more button below the list of results triggers additional books data to be fetched. The app is set to fetch 12 books per load.
